        Hey, meet my adorable puppy <b>COTTON!<img src=bone.png width="40"></b>
        She just turned one last January 9. We got her when she was 3 months old.
        Getting a puppy was probably one of the most exciting thing I have ever done.
        Cotton was my first puppy and believe me, first few weeks were not easy
        <i>(sleepless nights to be exact)</i>.<br><br>

        First of all, I do not know exactly how to raise nor train an excellent puppy.
        So I did a lot of reading and also watched videos. Guess what? she learned
        how to sit, YAY! My husband and I decided to enroll her to puppy classes and
        go to puppy plays. Puppy classes? I know, I said I read and watched videos
        on training your puppy. But having a professional guide you is really helpful
        and makes it a whole lot less frustrating.
        <br/>
        <br/>

     <p>Here is a very simple technique to teach your dog how to sit:<br/>
1. Hold a small piece of treat in your hand.<br/>
2.Put it in front of your dog’s nose<br/>
3.Slowly place it behind her nose (she will try to follow it)<br/>
4.Be patient and repeat it until she finally knows how to sit.<br/>
5.If he/she knows how to sit already, you can now practice doing 1 to 3 a little faster while saying the word “sit”.<br/>

Practice, practice and practice is the key.

        Cotton had her puppy level 1 and 2 classes at
        <a href="https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/petco-dog-training">
          Unleashed by Petco
        </a>
        with Steph as her trainer. Every Wednesday for 1 hour. So you really have
        to make time for your puppy. The training was all about obedience, not
        your tricks like “Play dead” <i>(that’s a really cool trick though)</i>.
        I don’t want to brag but hey, she’s pretty good now with sit, down, stay
        and wait.
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Here’s what we do every Wednesday for one hour: 
There are 2 other dogs enrolled in the class and they all have to be in a non retractable leash to maintain control and avoid your dog from distracting others. It is a positive style of training where we do not use punishments such as hitting the puppy or screaming out them. Why? One, it can ruin your bond with your dog because he/she will be scared of you. Two, sometimes they do not know why you are getting mad at them especially if the unaccepted behavior was a few minutes ago already. Instead, we reward good and acceptable behavior right away. The KEY is always acknowledging any good behavior as soon as possible otherwise, they would not now what the treat is for. I use the word “yes”  plus the treat to reward her good behavior. I also use the treat to guid her on what she is supposed to do.</p> 

<p style="text-align:center;">It is also very important that I remember that treats should have different values. For example a simple or easy command will be rewarded by low valued treats. While difficult commands that requires more effort will be rewarded with high valued treats such as boiled chicken or even a spam(she loves it a lot).</p>

        I mentioned that we did go to puppy plays. We brought her a few times to
        play with other puppies of her size. It is a way for her to socialize and
        get used to different environment. There were different props like strollers
        being pushed around, skateboard and even a sound of a crying baby!
        Is it helpful? I really think so, she doesn’t get startled with those
        sounds nor get scared of new things going on around her.

        The big question is, <b>IS HAVING A DOG WORTH INVESTING YOUR TIME? YEAH!</b>
        She is definitely worth my effort and time.
