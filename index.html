        Hey, meet my adorable puppy <b>COTTON!<img src=bone.png width="40"></b>
        She just turned one last January 9. We got her when she was 3 months old.
        Getting a puppy was probably one of the most exciting thing I have ever done.
        Cotton was my first puppy and believe me, first few weeks were not easy
        <i>(sleepless nights to be exact)</i>.<br><br>

        First of all, I do not know exactly how to raise nor train an excellent puppy.
        So I did a lot of reading and also watched videos. Guess what? she learned
        how to sit, YAY! My husband and I decided to enroll her to puppy classes and
        go to puppy plays. Puppy classes? I know, I said I read and watched videos
        on training your puppy. But having a professional guide you is really helpful
        and makes it a whole lot less frustrating.

        Cotton had her puppy level 1 and 2 classes at
        <a href="https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/petco-dog-training">
          Unleashed by Petco
        </a>
        with Steph as her trainer. Every Wednesday for 1 hour. So you really have
        to make time for your puppy. The training was all about obedience, not
        your tricks like “Play dead” <i>(that’s a really cool trick though)</i>.
        I don’t want to brag but hey, she’s pretty good now with sit, down, stay
        and wait.

        I mentioned that we did go to puppy plays. We brought her a few times to
        play with other puppies of her size. It is a way for her to socialize and
        get used to different environment. There were different props like strollers
        being pushed around, skateboard and even a sound of a crying baby!
        Is it helpful? I really think so, she doesn’t get startled with those
        sounds nor get scared of new things going on around her.

        The big question is, <b>IS HAVING A DOG WORTH INVESTING YOUR TIME? YEAH!</b>
        She is definitely worth my effort and time.
